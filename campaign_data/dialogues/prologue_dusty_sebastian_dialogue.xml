I must say I’m rather impressed by the solid wisdom in your way of thinking, young lady. But please, forgive me my manners. My name is Sebastian Rex. Who do I have this pleasure…”" speaker="Sebastian">

	<DialogueNode key="2" npc_text="“Alas, I’m afraid the “bloody idiot’s”, as you aptly put it, brothers in crime are conducting similar acts of sabotage elsewhere aboard this ship. It would appear they have orchestrated quite an operation, and unless they are stopped without undue delay, we may soon have more serious issues at hand than a leaking steam pipe.”" speaker="Sebastian">

However, there is a prototype device in my cabin that I have invented for non-lethal crowd control. In fact, I was on my way to present it to the constabulary of Kingsworth. If you would like to, shall we say, field test it, I would be most grateful.“" speaker="Sebastian">

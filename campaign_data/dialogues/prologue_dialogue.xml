That’s when I really started to feel the futility of all that fighting and requested a transfer to the medical corps. It was denied. Apparently the war effort needed more grunts with guns than people to keep said grunts alive. So I just learned what I could on my own, and Sebastian helped me when he was able. I’m afraid I still need to catch up with the number of lives saved as opposed to lives taken, though. But he was right. I do manage to sleep at nights every now and then.”" speaker="Tom">
